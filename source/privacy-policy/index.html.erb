We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences.

      <h2>Online Analytics and Advertising</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Analytics</strong></p>
      <p>We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">clicking here</a>. If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Online Advertising</strong></p>
